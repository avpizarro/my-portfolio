# Nextjs and Sanity Portfolio

This is a redesign to my portfolio after a trip to Cali, Colombia. It is inspired in the [Museo La Tertulia](https://museolatertulia.com/) website. The app is built with Nextjs and has the following sections: Projects, About and Techstack carrousel. There is also a contact section with a form built using KwesForms. 

The website is hosted on Vercel, and the data is managed in Sanity CMS.
