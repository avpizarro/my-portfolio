# Web Developer Portfolio

This is a redesign to my portfolio after a trip to Cali Colombia, inspired in the [Museo La Tertulia](https://museolatertulia.com/) website. It is built using Nextjs and has  the following sections: Projects, About and TechStack carrousel. There is also Contact form built using KwesForms. 

The website is hosted on Vercel, and the data is managed in Sanity CMS.
